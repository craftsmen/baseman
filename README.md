# Middleman

A Middleman template with my standard defaults.

## Getting Started

Start your new project by using this Middleman custom project template

```
middleman init YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER -T mehlah/baseman
```

```

Run the server

```
bundle exec middleman
```

Deploy to GitHub Pages

```
bundle exec middleman deploy
```

## Directories

Stylesheets, fonts, images, and JavaScript files go in the `/source/assets/` directory.
Vendor stylesheets and JavaScripts should go in each of their `/vendor/` directories.
